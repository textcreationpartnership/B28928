            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the <hi>Merchants &amp; Clothiers of this Kingdom,</hi> And all others concerned, in the Free Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture of ENGLAND To Holland, Flanders, Brabant and Germany.</head>
            <p>BY an Act, made in the first Year of Their Majesties Reign, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>An Act for the better preventing the Exportation of Wool, and encouraging the Woollen Manufactures of this Kingdom,</hi> it is for the better Encouragement of the Manufacture, as well as the Growth of Wool, enacted; that from thenceforward it should and might be lawful to and for any Person or Persons whatsoever to Buy any Cloth, Stuffs, Stockins, or other Manufacture of Wool, made in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or the Town of <hi>Berwick upon Tweed:</hi> and the same freely, without any Molestation or Trouble whatsoever, to Export into any Parts beyond the Seas, paying the usual Customs.</p>
            <p>Which Act passed the Royal Assent the Twentieth Day of <hi>August,</hi> 1689. and was to continue for three Years, and from thence to the End of the next Session of Parliament, which is this present Session.</p>
            <p>Since the making of which Act there hath been Exported to <hi>Holland, Flanders, Brabant</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> far greater Quantities of the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of <hi>England,</hi> notwithstanding the Obstruction of Commerce, by reason of the present War, than was exported before, when the Trade was limited to the Members of the <hi>Hamborough Company</hi> only, as by the Entries in the Books of Their Majesties Customs plainly appears: By which Increase of the Woollen Manufacture exported, Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Customs, and the Price of Wool, hath been considerably advanced, so that the Continuance of the said Free Trade will be very beneficial to Their Majesties and their Subjects; whereas if the Trade in the Woollen Manufacture be restrained, it will be very prejudicial, not only to the Merchants and Clothiers of this Kingdom, but to all other Persons, whose Commodities they Use and Consume.</p>
            <p>It is the Interest of this Nation to invite all Persons to Buy and Export the Woollen Manufacture of <hi>England,</hi> for that a Pound of Wool, when wrought, yield then times the Value of the Wool, there being many Thousand Families maintained thereby, and several Trades that depend wholly on the Woollen Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> the Washer, Shearer, Picker, Comber, Karder, Reeler, Warper, Spinner, Knitter, Weaver, Clothworker, Tucker, Fuller, Drawer, Napper, Kalenderer, Dyer, Setter and Packer, besides several other Trades, whose Commodities they consume, as the Makers of Wyer, Cardmakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly hoped, That Leave will be given to bring in a Bill for the Continuance of the said Free Trade in the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Holland, Flanders, Brabant</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and that the said Bill may be past into an Act of Parliament.</p>
